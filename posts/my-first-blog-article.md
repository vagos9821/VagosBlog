# 🏡 Coding in Laravel from Home – With My Kitten! 🐱

> There's nothing quite like writing elegant Laravel code with a tiny, curious furball napping on your keyboard.

## ☕ Setting the Scene: Home Office & Laravel Setup

Working from home as a **Laravel developer** has its perks:  
✅ No commute  
✅ Unlimited coffee  
✅ The best pair-programmer – my **kitten!** 🐾  

My setup includes:  
- **Laravel 10** with 🛠️ `sail` for local development  
- **VS Code** (which my kitten loves to walk on)  
- **TailwindCSS** for styling those beautiful dashboards  

## 🖥️ When Your Kitten is the Project Manager  

Here’s what a typical coding session looks like:  

```php
// Attempting to write Laravel code while kitten naps on keyboard
Route::get('/kitten', function () {
    return view('kitten', ['cuteness' => 100]);
});
