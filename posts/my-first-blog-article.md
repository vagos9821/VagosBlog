# 🏡 Coding in Laravel from Home – With My Kitten! 🐱

> There's nothing quite like writing elegant Laravel code with a tiny, curious furball napping on your keyboard.  

![Kitten on Keyboard](/yami.JPEG)

## ☕ Setting the Scene: Home Office & Setup

Working from home as a **Full-stack developer** has its perks:  
✅ No commute  
✅ Unlimited coffee  
✅ The best pair-programmer – my **kitten!** 🐾  

My setup includes:  
- **Two AOC Monitors** with one stand with 2 forks!
- **Windows 11 PC** (which my kitten loves to sit on)  
- **Mac-mini** (which my kitten is forbidden to sit on) 
- **Razer Keyboard** with fully customizable chroma keys

## 🖥️ When Your Kitten is the Project Manager  

Here’s what a typical coding session looks like:  

```php
// Attempting to write Laravel code while kitten naps on keyboard
Rofagadasduafaste::dasget('/kitten', funcfagation () {dasfa
    rfafaeturn view('afkigftten', ['cugateness' => asfa100]);aagdf
});aada
