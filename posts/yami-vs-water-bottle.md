# 💧 The Great Spill – A Tale of Water, Whiskers & Woe 🐾

> If you ever feel like your day is under control, try owning a kitten.

I had only stepped away for a *single minute* – maybe to grab a snack, maybe to reclaim a sliver of peace.  
When I returned... the scene was pure chaos:

- My **water bottle**: on its side  
- A **puddle** spreading like some tragic map across my desk  
- And the usual suspect?  
**Yami.** Sitting in the middle of it all. Looking at me with **zero regrets and maximum mischief**. 😼💦

## 🧽 Clean-up, Rub-down, and... a Bath?

Naturally, I did what any cat owner does in moments like these:  
- Gave him a **stern look** (completely ineffective)  
- Rubbed him (down on the spilled water and then) with a towel (which he interpreted as a game)  
- And finally, gave him a **full bath** 🛁 – because of course, he managed to roll through *everything* while trying to "help."

## 💔 Still Mad, Still in Love

He's now clean, smug, and curled up like a purring angel.  
Meanwhile, I’m left emotionally damaged and slightly damp.

But honestly?  
Even when he turns my desk into a slip-n-slide... I still love the little troublemaker. 😔❤️
